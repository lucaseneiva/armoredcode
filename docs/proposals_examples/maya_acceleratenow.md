# Proposal - Rapid Security Assessment & Remediation for AccelerateNow

Dear Sarah,

I understand AccelerateNow's urgent need for expert security assistance. My proven experience in web application security, specifically within the NodeJS/React/MongoDB stack, positions me to deliver the rapid and comprehensive solutions you require.

## My Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Assessment & Mitigation

* **Prioritized Vulnerability Scanning:** Initial scan completed within 48 hours, a detailed report with findings within 72 hours. 
* **Manual Code Review:**  Focus on critical areas completed concurrently with the scan, with initial recommendations within 5 business days.
* **Risk Assessment:** Prioritized risk report submitted alongside code review recommendations.
* **Actionable Remediation Plans:**  Delivered within 2 business days of risk report, allowing for collaboration with your development team. I'm available for 5 hours of direct consultation to ensure the implementation aligns with your priorities. 

### Phase 2: Proactive Protection (Optional)

* **Routine Pen-Testing:**  Scheduled simulated attacks to uncover vulnerabilities as your platform evolves.
* **Secure Coding Workshops:**  Empowering your developers with best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities from being introduced.
* **Threat Modeling:** I'll work with your team to proactively identify and mitigate potential attack vectors.

## Fees

* **Phase 1: Fixed price of $7,500 USD.** This includes all deliverables outlined above.
* **Urgent Remediation (if required):** $180/hour with an estimated maximum of 20 hours if extensive code changes are needed.
* **Phase 2: Proactive Protection:** We can discuss this after Phase 1.  A typical retainer for a platform of your size starts at $2,500/month for scheduled pen-testing and quarterly threat modeling. 

## Timeline Guarantee

I understand urgency is paramount. Barring unforeseen complexities, I commit to completing Phase 1 deliverables within a maximum of 10 business days from project start.

I share your commitment to data protection.  My work will not only address immediate threats, but position AccelerateNow for long-term security success.

I'm eager to discuss my plan in detail.  

Sincerely,
Maya Singh
