### Executive Summary

Having conducted numerous penetration tests on both legacy and cloud-native applications, I understand the unique security risks that accompany cloud migrations.  My expertise lies in uncovering critical vulnerabilities, translating technical findings for developers, and advocating for proactive security measures throughout the SDLC.  My proposed solution aims to:

* **Reveal Hidden Risks:** A thorough pentest of both your legacy Java system and the planned cloud environment to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
* **Developer-Centric Approach:** Security training designed from an attacker's perspective, empowering developers to think about how exploits work and code defensively. 
* **Strategic Cloud Security:** Guidance on cloud configuration risks, attack surface mapping, and DevSecOps considerations tailored to mitigate cloud-specific threats.

I'm committed to working closely with MidSize Solutions to prioritize security from the outset, preventing costly post-launch breaches. 

### My Proposed Solution

My solution combines hands-on vulnerability discovery with tailored training and strategic consulting for holistic security improvement:

#### Phase 1: In-Depth Vulnerability Assessment (Pre-Migration)

* **Scope:** Black-box penetration testing and architecture review of your Java application.  Estimated 2-3 weeks depending on complexity.
* **Deliverable:** Prioritized report with findings, including 1-hour results briefing with your tech team.
* **Timeline Goal:** Completion within 4 weeks of project start, aligning with your urgent pre-migration need.

#### Phase 2: Attacker-Focused Secure Coding

* **Training Format:** Two half-day workshops, with hands-on exercises. Can be split into shorter sessions for team convenience.
* **Content:**  Tailored based on Phase 1 findings, but likely covering OWASP Top 10, threat modeling for Java apps.
* **Timeline Goal:** Ideally within 2-3 months of Phase 1 for momentum and maximum impact.

#### Phase 3:  Cloud & DevSecOps Risk Consultation

* **Focus:** Dependent on MidSize Solutions' planned cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, etc.) and development workflows.
* **Scope:** Threat modeling session, architecture design review, optional DevSecOps tool demo if desired. 
* **Timeline Goal:**  Best aligned with your cloud migration roadmap for optimal security configuration from the start. Flexible duration.

### Pricing

* **Phase 1:**  Project-based pricing upon review of system scope. Estimate: $10,000 - $15,000 USD.
* **Phase 2:**  $4000 USD total for workshop development and delivery.
* **Phase 3:**  Hourly consulting rate of $150 USD. Initial assessment likely requires 8-16 hours, ongoing support flexible.

### Timeline

* **Availability:** Ready to start immediately contingent on MidSize Solutions' legacy system access readiness. 
* **Priority:** Given the urgency, Phase 1 is prioritized. Subsequent phases' timing is adaptable to your migration and development schedules.
