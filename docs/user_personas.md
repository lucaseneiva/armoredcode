# ArmoredCode User Personas

## Freelancer Personas

**Persona 1: Maya, the Secure Coding Champion**

* **Background:** 8+ years experience as a software developer, the last 3 with a conscious shift towards secure coding practices. Frustrated by witnessing vulnerability-riddled projects in previous roles.
* **Skills:**
    * Deep understanding of OWASP Top 10, secure coding techniques in multiple languages (Java, Python, etc.).
    * Experience integrating security into CI/CD pipelines (SAST, DAST tools).
    * Familiar with relevant standards/frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.)
* **Pain Points**
    * Finding projects that prioritize security from the outset, and clients who understand its value.
    * Struggling with outdated development practices within teams that don't see security as a priority.
    * Wants to stay up-to-date on the latest attack vectors and best practices.
* **Goals**
    * Work on projects valuing secure development,  allowing her to make a real impact.
    * Collaborate with like-minded security professionals.
    * Build a portfolio showcasing projects with strong security implementation. 

**Persona 2: Alex, the AppSec Pen-Tester**

* **Background:** Ethical hacker turned software security specialist. Self-taught, with some industry certifications (e.g., OSCP, CEH).
* **Skills:**
    * Expert in web and mobile app pen-testing (black-box, some grey-box).
    * Solid understanding of common software vulnerabilities and attack techniques.
    * Able to write clear, actionable vulnerability reports for developers.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Irregular work. Finds clients through word-of-mouth, not a dedicated platform.
    * Clients sometimes don't grasp the severity of findings, or lack budget to fix everything.
    * Wants to work preventatively, not just after a project is built. 
* **Goals:**
     * Consistent stream of well-scoped projects with security-aware clients.
     * Collaborate with developers directly to fix issues during development, not after. 
     * Gain more experience in specific verticals (healthcare, finance) for specialization.

**Persona 3: Zara, the DevSecOps Consultant**

* **Background:**  Seasoned DevOps engineer (10+ years), recently obtained DevSecOps certifications. Worked in fast-paced agile environments.
* **Skills:**
    * Automation of security tools  and testing throughout the SDLC.
    * Strong infrastructure knowledge (cloud a plus), enabling secure configurations. 
    * Can effectively communicate security needs to developers and stakeholders.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Teams that view security as 'slowing things down'. Battles over friction vs. risk. 
    * Lack of buy-in from management to invest in the right security toolset.
    * Finding clients who see DevSecOps as an investment, not overhead. 
* **Goals:**
     * Work on projects where security is 'baked-in'. 
     * Help teams achieve a truly collaborative DevSecOps culture.
     * Position herself as a strategic advisor, not just an implementer.

## Client Personas

### AccelerateNow,  the Growth-Driven Startup

* **Background:** A rapidly growing SaaS startup offering an innovative collaboration platform.  Focused on new features and user acquisition, but some recent embarrassing data leaks.
* **Needs:**
    * Quick access to freelancers for vulnerability patching and code review of critical components.
    * Pen-testers specializing in their tech stack (NodeJS, React, MongoDB) to find  issues before attackers do.
    * Reassurance:  Clear explanations of risks in terms their non-security-savvy CEO can understand.
* **Pain Points:**
    * No in-house security team. Their core devs are too busy building new features.
    * Worried they're a bigger target for cyberattacks because of the recent publicity.
    * Unsure how to budget for security or prioritize the scariest-sounding vulnerabilities.

* **Example Project:** [acceleratenow.md](project_examples/acceleratenow.md)

### MidSize Solutions, the Established Software Firm

* **Background:** Medium-sized company with legacy enterprise software (mostly Java-based).  Beginning a cloud migration and modernization push.
* **Needs:**
    * A secure coding consultant to help embed secure practices into their development teams long-term.
    * Thorough security audit of their core product before it moves to the cloud.
    * DevSecOps help to establish the right toolchain and processes for their new cloud-native projects.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Developers with long tenure aren't used to prioritizing security. 
    * Worried about compliance risks (PCI-DSS relevant) as they move into more sensitive client work.
    * Leadership wants to modernize but doesn't fully understand the security risks of the cloud.

* **Example Project:** [midsizesolutions.md](project_examples/midsizesolutions.md)

###  HealthSafe, the Healthcare Tech Provider

* **Background:**  Software vendor creating patient data management systems for hospitals.  Highly regulated (HIPAA) with strict security obligations.
* **Needs:**
    * Extremely well-vetted developers with proven experience in secure healthcare software.
    * May need help beyond development: secure architecture reviews, threat modeling, compliance guidance.
    * Prioritized confidentiality. Client data leakage could literally ruin their company. 
* **Pain Points**
    * Finding specialized devs with the right experience and willingness to work within regulations.
    * Smaller applicant pool for niche skills makes hiring slow and expensive.
    * Unsure if freelancers *truly* adhere to the same standards as full-time employees.
