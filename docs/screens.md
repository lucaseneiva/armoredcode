# Screens

All screens are based on our top 6 core feeatures. The following core features are the most important and paramount for the ArmoredCode platform:

1. **Project Management**
   - The ability for clients to create and manage cybersecurity projects related to software development is at the heart of the platform. Features like structured project postings, work item management, and proposal review/acceptance are critical for facilitating the collaboration between clients and freelancers.

2. **Freelancer Profiles**
   - Having comprehensive and verified profiles for freelancers is essential for clients to assess their skills, experience, and suitability for specific projects. Features like security specializations, work samples, certifications, work experience, and verification mechanisms are crucial for establishing trust and enabling effective matching between projects and freelancers.

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Robust search and filtering capabilities are paramount for both clients and freelancers to find relevant projects and professionals, respectively. Clients need to be able to filter freelancers based on skills, technologies, and security specializations, while freelancers need to filter projects based on their expertise and preferences.

4. **Secure Communication**
   - Given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity projects, secure communication channels are a core requirement. Features like encrypted project-specific messaging, file sharing with security focus, and chat histories ensure that sensitive information is protected during project collaboration.

5. **Proposal Submission and Review**
   - The ability for freelancers to submit proposals for projects and for clients to review and accept those proposals is a critical component of the platform's workflow. Features like cover letters, pricing options (fixed-price or hourly), and proposal status tracking are essential for facilitating this process.

6. **Feedback and Reviews**
   - Providing a mechanism for clients and freelancers to provide feedback and reviews on completed projects is important for building trust, reputation, and continuous improvement within the platform's ecosystem.


## Project Management:

Designed for clients to initiate new project listings.

#### Key Elements:

    * Projects Recommended to a Freelancer (based on their profile)
    * Freelancers Recommended to a Client (based on project details) 
    * Brief Explanation of Why Each Match is Suggested (e.g., "This project matches your top 3 skills")

### Points for Further Exploration

### Additional Considerations

* **Security:**  Consider highlighting any security measures in place (file encryption, message history retention policies, etc.), especially if that's a selling point for your platform
* **Accessibility:** Think about features for users with disabilities (e.g., text transcripts for video calls, alternative text descriptions for images).

    * Might influence a freelancer's decision to bid on a client's projects

### Important Considerations
