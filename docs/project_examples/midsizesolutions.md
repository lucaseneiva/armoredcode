# Security Transformation for MidSize Solutions' Cloud Migration & Modernization

**Company:** MidSize Solutions (https://www.midsizesolutions.com)

## **Project Overview**

MidSize Solutions is embarking on an ambitious cloud migration and modernization initiative. We recognize that robust security is paramount for protecting our legacy software and ensuring a secure transition to cloud-native development.  We are seeking a collaborative security partner to guide us through this transformation.

## **Scope of Work**

* **Phase 1: Legacy Software Security Audit:**  A comprehensive audit of our core Java-based enterprise product to identify vulnerabilities before cloud migration.  Strong focus on PCI-DSS compliance.
* **Phase 2:  Secure Coding Education:**  Develop and deliver tailored training programs to embed secure coding practices into our established development teams.  Emphasize mindset shift and real-world application. 
* **Phase 3: DevSecOps Transformation:**  Consultation and hands-on assistance to select and implement the appropriate DevSecOps toolchain and processes to support our cloud-native development initiatives.

## **Ideal Partner:**

* **Proven Experience:** Demonstrable expertise in enterprise Java security, secure coding practices, and cloud security (ideally AWS, Azure, or GCP – whichever is their target).
* **Compliance Knowledge:**  In-depth understanding of PCI-DSS and its implications for both legacy systems and cloud environments.
* **Educational Approach:** A talent for explaining complex security concepts to developers of varying experience levels and adapting training to promote secure practices adoption.
* **Change Agent Mentality:** Ability to inspire a culture change and champion security throughout our organization, from developers to leadership.

## **Project Timeline:**

* **Phase 1 - Legacy Audit:**  Urgent – to be completed within 4-6 weeks before cloud migration commences.
* **Phase 2 - Secure Coding Education:**  Ongoing training modules delivered over 3-6 months to support adoption.
* **Phase 3 - DevSecOps Transformation:** Implementation guidance in parallel with our cloud migration rollout. Flexible timeframe, aiming for key milestones within 6-12 months.

## **Budget:**

* **Phase 1:** Budget range of $20,000 - $35,000 depending on the system's complexity.
* **Phase 2:** $10,000 - $20,000 for curriculum development, plus delivery costs based on the chosen format (workshops, online, etc.).
* **Phase 3:** Initial consultation $5,000 - $10,000, plus ongoing costs based on selected tooling and level of implementation support needed.

## **To Apply:**

Please submit the following:

* Case studies demonstrating similar security transformation projects.
* Examples of successful secure coding training curriculums.
* Recommendations for DevSecOps tooling and processes aligned with our needs.
