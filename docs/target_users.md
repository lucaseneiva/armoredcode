## Personas

### Freelancer

#### Maya, the Secure Coding Champion

* **Background:** 8+ years experience as a software developer, the last 3 with a conscious shift towards secure coding practices. Frustrated by witnessing vulnerability-riddled projects in previous roles.
* **Skills:**
    * Deep understanding of OWASP Top 10, secure coding techniques in multiple languages (Java, Python, etc.).
    * Experience integrating security into CI/CD pipelines (SAST, DAST tools).
    * Familiar with relevant standards/frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.)
* **Pain Points**
    * Finding projects that prioritize security from the outset, and clients who understand its value.
    * Struggling with outdated development practices within teams that don't see security as a priority.
    * Wants to stay up-to-date on the latest attack vectors and best practices.

#### Alex, the AppSec Pen-Tester

* **Background:** Ethical hacker turned software security specialist. Self-taught, with some industry certifications (e.g., OSCP, CEH).
* **Skills:**
    * Expert in web and mobile app pen-testing (black-box, some grey-box).
    * Solid understanding of common software vulnerabilities and attack techniques.
    * Able to write clear, actionable vulnerability reports for developers.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Irregular work. Finds clients through word-of-mouth, not a dedicated platform.
    * Clients sometimes don't grasp the severity of findings, or lack budget to fix everything.
    * Wants to work preventatively, not just after a project is built. 
* **Goals:**
     * Consistent stream of well-scoped projects with security-aware clients.
     * Collaborate with developers directly to fix issues during development, not after. 
     * Gain more experience in specific verticals (healthcare, finance) for specialization.

### Client Personas

#### AccelerateNow,  the Growth-Driven Startup

* **Background:** A rapidly growing SaaS startup offering an innovative collaboration platform.  Focused on new features and user acquisition, but some recent embarrassing data leaks.
* **Needs:**
    * Quick access to freelancers for vulnerability patching and code review of critical components.
    * Pen-testers specializing in their tech stack (NodeJS, React, MongoDB) to find  issues before attackers do.
    * Reassurance:  Clear explanations of risks in terms their non-security-savvy CEO can understand.
* **Pain Points:**
    * No in-house security team. Their core devs are too busy building new features.
    * Worried they're a bigger target for cyberattacks because of the recent publicity.

* **Needs:**
    * A secure coding consultant to help embed secure practices into their development teams long-term.
    * Thorough security audit of their core product before it moves to the cloud.
    * DevSecOps help to establish the right toolchain and processes for their new cloud-native projects.
* **Pain Points:**
    * Developers with long tenure aren't used to prioritizing security. 
    * Worried about compliance risks (PCI-DSS relevant) as they move into more sensitive client work.

* **Pain Points**
    * Finding specialized devs with the right experience and willingness to work within regulations.
    * Smaller applicant pool for niche skills makes hiring slow and expensive.
    * Unsure if freelancers *truly* adhere to the same standards as full-time employees.
