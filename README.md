![1711059552226](https://github.com/lucasneiva/armoredcode/assets/112989505/b31cf012-797c-4567-aca1-6ee47770988a)
## **Problem Statement**

Companies of all sizes face mounting cybersecurity threats, often stemming from vulnerabilities introduced during software development. Finding qualified cybersecurity professionals with deep development knowledge remains a challenge, while many in-house teams lack this specialized expertise.

## **The ArmoredCode Solution**

ArmoredCode bridges this gap with a platform tailored to the intersection of cybersecurity and software development. We offer:

* **Project Postings:**
    - Structured form ensuring clients provide the necessary security context.
    - Fields for tech stack, vulnerability focus, compliance needs (if relevant), timeframe urgency, and budget range.
* **Freelancer Profiles:**
    - Security specialization emphasis (Pen-Test, Code Review, DevSecOps, etc.)
    - Skills filtering/tagging
    - Experience level (Even if basic: Junior, Mid, Senior)
    - Option for a brief service offering blurb (seeds the later expansion)
    - Verification (tiered if possible: basic ID check builds more trust than none)

* **Search & Filtering:**
    - Freelancers must find relevant projects easily. Skill/tech stack filters are vital.
* **Secure Communication:**
    - Project-specific messaging (encrypted).
    File sharing with security focus (limit sizes, scanning if possible).
    - Core Chat Features: [chat.md](docs/chat.md)
* **Freelancer "Pitching":**
    - Short proposals or a way to express interest directly to the client per project.
